System Design for an API Rate Limiter
1️⃣ Problem Statement
Design a Rate Limiting System that restricts the number of API requests a user can make within a given time window. 
The system should support different rate-limiting strategies like Fixed Window, Sliding Window, Token Bucket, and Leaky Bucket.

2️⃣ Functional Requirements
✅ Limit API requests based on user identity (IP, API Key, or User ID).
✅ Deny requests that exceed the allowed limit.
✅ Support multiple limit types (e.g., 100 requests per minute).
✅ Efficient storage of request counts for high performance.
✅ Scalability to handle high traffic.


3️⃣ Non-Functional Requirements
⚡ Low Latency: The rate limiter should be fast.
📈 Scalability: Should work across multiple servers.
🛡️ High Availability: Must handle failures gracefully.



4️⃣ Rate Limiting Algorithms
Different rate-limiting algorithms can be used:
    
    

Algorithm	Pros	Cons
Fixed Window Counter	Simple, easy to implement	Sudden burst at window reset
Sliding Window Log	Accurate tracking	High storage usage
Sliding Window Counter	Balanced approach	Small memory overhead
Token Bucket	Smooth request flow	Slight complexity
Leaky Bucket	Maintains request rate	Queues requests


We'll implement Sliding Window Counter because it balances efficiency and accuracy.

5️⃣ System Architecture
🔹 Client Requests → Load Balancer → API Gateway → Rate Limiter (Redis) → Application Servers

🔹 Components
API Gateway (e.g., Nginx, Kong, AWS API Gateway)

Routes requests to backend servers.
Can handle rate limiting (but limited in flexibility).

Rate Limiter Service

Intercepts API requests.
Uses Redis for efficient request counting.
Returns 429 Too Many Requests when the limit is exceeded.

Storage (Redis)

Stores request counts with expiration time.
Supports atomic operations for fast updates.

Application Servers

Process valid API requests.
Reject excessive requests.



Handling a New Project Request
When handling a new project request, the key is to gather requirements, assess feasibility, and plan execution efficiently. Here's a structured approach:

1. Understand the Project Requirements
Gather details: What problem does this project solve?
Define scope: Features, functionalities, and expected outcomes.
Identify stakeholders: Who are the users? Who approves decisions?
Ask for existing documentation: Any references, previous versions, or inspirations?


✅ Example:
If it’s a Django-based OTT platform, ask:

Do you need user authentication (OAuth, JWT)?
Should it support video streaming (HLS, MPEG-DASH)?
What payment methods are required?



2. Evaluate Feasibility & Technology Stack
Backend: Django (Django REST Framework for APIs), Celery (async tasks)
Frontend: React, Next.js, or plain HTML/CSS
Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB
Infrastructure: AWS, GCP, or DigitalOcean
Third-party services: Payment gateways (Stripe, Razorpay), Streaming (Mediaconvert, FFmpeg)
✅ Example Decision:
For a real-time stock trading app, WebSockets & Redis are needed.


3. Timeline & Estimation
Break down tasks into milestones (Sprint 1, Sprint 2, etc.).
Estimate resources: Time, developers, budget.
Identify risks: Tech limitations, compliance issues (GDPR, HIPAA).
✅ Example Estimation:
A Django e-commerce website could take:

Week 1-2: Authentication & database setup
Week 3-4: Product catalog & checkout
Week 5-6: Payment integration & testing



4. Create a Development Plan
Agile or Waterfall?
Define CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
Decide on testing strategy: Unit tests (pytest), Integration tests.
Security measures: OAuth, API rate limiting, JWT authentication.
✅ Example:
For an OTT platform, ensure:

DRM Protection for videos
Load balancing via AWS ALB
Redis caching for faster performance



5. Execution & Regular Reviews
Code versioning (Git: git flow, PR reviews).
Daily stand-ups (for Agile teams).
Frequent demos to stakeholders.
Monitoring & logging (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK).
✅ Example:
For a Django REST API, use:

django-debug-toolbar for debugging
Sentry for error tracking
Celery + Redis for async jobs




6. Deployment & Handover
Cloud hosting: AWS, Azure, GCP.
Containerization: Docker, Kubernetes.
API documentation: Swagger, Postman.
Training & documentation for the team.
✅ Example:
For a FinTech app, deploy via:

AWS Lambda (serverless) for cost efficiency.
Terraform for infrastructure as code.
CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.



Final Checklist
✅ Requirements gathered & documented
✅ Tech stack decided
✅ Project timeline & milestones planned
✅ Infrastructure & security planned
✅ Deployment & monitoring setup



How to Migrate Legacy Code to New Technology
Migrating legacy code to new technology is a challenging but necessary process to ensure scalability, maintainability, and security. Here’s a structured approach:
    


1. Understand the Existing System
Before migration, analyze:
✅ Architecture – Is it monolithic or microservices?
✅ Tech Stack – Which frameworks, databases, and dependencies are used?
✅ Code Complexity – Are there tight couplings or spaghetti code?
✅ Business Logic – What are the core functionalities that must be preserved?

🔍 Tools to Analyze Legacy Code:

Code Scanners: SonarQube (code quality analysis)
Dependency Checkers: Pipreqs (for Python), npm-check (for Node.js)
Profiling Tools: cProfile (for Python), Chrome DevTools (for frontend)


2. Identify Migration Goals
Set clear migration objectives:
✅ Performance Improvement – Reduce latency, improve scalability.
✅ Modernization – Shift from outdated libraries (e.g., Python 2.x → Python 3.x).
✅ Security Enhancements – Fix vulnerabilities, remove deprecated dependencies.
✅ Scalability – Move from monolithic to microservices, implement Kubernetes/Docker.

3. Choose the Right Modern Tech Stack
🔹 If migrating a monolithic Django app, consider:
✅ Django REST Framework (DRF) for API-driven development.
✅ GraphQL (alternative to REST for better flexibility).
✅ React.js/Next.js for frontend (instead of Jinja templates).
✅ PostgreSQL + Redis (better query optimization & caching).
✅ Celery + RabbitMQ (for background tasks).
✅ Docker + Kubernetes (for containerized deployments).

4. Plan a Step-by-Step Migration Strategy
A. Incremental Migration (Recommended for Large Systems)
If the system is critical, don't rewrite everything at once.
Instead, migrate module by module (e.g., Authentication → API → Database).
Example:
✅ Convert frontend from Django templates to React.js while keeping Django as a backend.
✅ Refactor Django ORM queries for better performance.
✅ Gradually migrate monolithic services to microservices (FastAPI, Flask, Node.js, etc.).

B. Full Rewrite (Only for Small Projects)
If the project is small, a full rewrite might be faster.
However, ensure:
✅ Feature parity (new system must match old functionality).
✅ Adequate testing (unit, integration, and performance tests).
✅ A rollback plan (in case the migration fails).

5. Set Up Automated Testing & CI/CD

Before making changes, implement:
✅ Unit Tests (pytest, Django TestCase) to verify each function works.
✅ Integration Tests to check APIs & database interactions.
✅ Load Testing (Locust, JMeter) to ensure performance.
✅ CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD) for automated deployments.


6. Migrate Database & Data Safely
🔹 If switching databases (e.g., MySQL → PostgreSQL):
✅ Use Django's inspectdb to generate models from an existing database.
✅ Write migration scripts (Alembic for SQLAlchemy, Django Migrations for Django ORM).
✅ Ensure zero downtime by using Blue-Green Deployment or Rolling Updates.
✅ Backup everything before making changes.


7. Optimize & Deploy the New System
✅ Optimize Queries – Use indexing, partitioning, caching (Redis).
✅ Deploy on Cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure) – Use ECS, EKS, or Lambda for microservices.
✅ Monitor Performance – Use Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack.



8. Train Developers & Maintain Documentation
✅ Provide training sessions on new technologies.
✅ Maintain API Docs (Swagger, Postman, Redoc).
✅ Use Confluence or Notion for architecture documentation.


Example Migration Plan: Django Monolith → Django + React + Kubernetes
1️⃣ Phase 1: API-First Approach

Convert Django views to Django REST Framework (DRF).
Expose APIs for the frontend.
2️⃣ Phase 2: Frontend Modernization

Replace Jinja templates with React.js (or Next.js).
3️⃣ Phase 3: Performance Optimization

Implement Redis caching, PostgreSQL indexing, Celery tasks.
4️⃣ Phase 4: Containerization & Cloud Migration

Dockerize the app, deploy using AWS ECS/EKS (or Kubernetes).
Final Thoughts
🔹 Don't migrate everything at once—go step by step.
🔹 Ensure zero downtime by using blue-green deployments.
🔹 Use CI/CD pipelines to automate testing & deployment.
🔹 Monitor & optimize continuously (performance, security, scaling).


Partitioning and sharding both refer to dividing a database into smaller, more manageable pieces to improve performance and scalability.
 However, they differ in scope and implementation:
 
 
 1. Partitioning
Partitioning is a broader concept that refers to dividing a single table into multiple partitions based on certain criteria. It can be applied within a single database instance or across multiple instances.

Types of Partitioning:
Horizontal Partitioning: Splits rows of a table across multiple partitions.
Example: Users with ID 1-1000 go to partition A, and 1001-2000 go to partition B.
Vertical Partitioning: Splits columns of a table across multiple partitions.
Example: A "Users" table is split so that personal info (name, email) is in one partition, and login info (password, last login) is in another.


Example Use Case:
A large customer database where recent data is stored in one partition and older data in another for faster queries.

2. Sharding
Sharding is a specific type of partitioning where data is distributed across multiple database servers (nodes). Each shard acts as an independent database.

How Sharding Works:
Each shard contains a subset of data (usually through horizontal partitioning).
The application needs a way to determine which shard contains the required data.
Often used in distributed databases like MongoDB, MySQL Cluster, and Cassandra.

Example Use Case:
A social media platform where user data is split across multiple servers based on user ID ranges to prevent a single database from becoming a bottleneck.

Key Differences:
Feature	Partitioning	Sharding
Scope	Can be within a single database	Spans multiple databases
Implementation	Divides tables into partitions	Distributes data across multiple servers
Data Distribution	Rows or columns are split logically	Each shard holds a subset of data
Scalability	Limited to a single database instance	Allows scaling by adding more shards
Failure Impact	A partition failure may not affect the whole database	A shard failure can impact specific data sets

When to Use What?
Use Partitioning when you want to optimize a single database for performance.
Use Sharding when your application needs to scale beyond a single database server.


Partitioning in a single server involves dividing a large table into smaller partitions to improve query performance, manageability, and storage efficiency. 
The database engine still manages all partitions within the same physical server, avoiding the complexity of a distributed system.


Types of Partitioning in a Single Server
1. Horizontal Partitioning (Row-Based)
Divides data row-wise into multiple partitions based on a partition key.
Each partition contains a subset of rows but maintains the same schema.
Example in MySQL (Range Partitioning)

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    created_at DATE NOT NULL
)
PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(created_at)) (
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (2020),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (2022),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (2024)
);


Benefit: Queries that filter by created_at will only scan relevant partitions

2. Vertical Partitioning (Column-Based)
Splits a table into multiple smaller tables with different columns.
Useful when certain columns are queried more frequently than others.
Example
Instead of a single table:

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    password_hash VARCHAR(255),
    last_login TIMESTAMP
);


Split it into two tables:
 CREATE TABLE user_basic (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE user_auth (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255),
    last_login TIMESTAMP
);

Benefit: Queries that don’t require authentication data (e.g., SELECT name FROM user_basic) run faster.
3. List Partitioning
Partitions data based on a list of predefined values.
Example

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(20)
)
PARTITION BY LIST COLUMNS(department) (
    PARTITION p_sales VALUES IN ('Sales'),
    PARTITION p_hr VALUES IN ('HR'),
    PARTITION p_engineering VALUES IN ('Engineering')
);


Benefit: Queries filtering by department only scan the relevant partition.

4. Hash Partitioning
Uses a hash function to distribute rows across partitions.
Useful for evenly distributing data.
Example
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT NOT NULL,
    customer_id INT NOT NULL
)
PARTITION BY HASH(customer_id) PARTITIONS 4;


Benefit: Avoids data skew and balances load.

Benefits of Partitioning in a Single Server
✅ Faster Queries – Queries can scan only relevant partitions.
✅ Efficient Storage Management – Older or less-used data can be stored separately.
✅ Better Indexing – Indexes are smaller and more efficient per partition.
✅ Improved Maintainability – Can delete old data partitions without impacting active data.


Yes, partitioning can be implemented across multiple servers, but when data is spread across multiple servers, 
it is typically referred to as sharding rather than traditional partitioning.


Partitioning vs. Sharding
Partitioning (Single Server or Multiple Servers)
Data is divided into smaller logical subsets (partitions).
The database engine manages partitions internally.
Can be implemented on a single server or multiple servers.
Sharding (Distributed Partitioning Across Multiple Servers)
A special type of partitioning where data is stored across multiple physical servers.
The application or database explicitly routes queries to the correct shard.
Used in high-scale distributed systems.




Partitioning Across Multiple Servers
While traditional partitioning is managed within a single database server, modern databases allow partitioning across multiple servers in distributed databases.

1. Horizontal Partitioning Across Multiple Servers (Sharding)
Each partition (shard) resides on a separate physical server.
Example: Users with IDs 1-1000 are stored in Server A, and IDs 1001-2000 in Server B.
Example in MongoDB (Sharding)

sh.enableSharding("myDatabase")
sh.shardCollection("myDatabase.users", { "user_id": "hashed" })



Benefit: Each server handles only a portion of the queries, improving scalability.

2. Distributed Partitioning with NewSQL Databases
Databases like Google Spanner, YugabyteDB, and CockroachDB allow data partitioning across multiple nodes while ensuring consistency.
Automatic partitioning is handled by the database.
Example in Google Spanner

CREATE TABLE Users (
    user_id INT64 NOT NULL,
    name STRING(100),
    email STRING(100)
) PRIMARY KEY (user_id),
INTERLEAVE IN PARENT UserGroups ON DELETE CASCADE;

Benefit: The database automatically distributes partitions across multiple nodes.



3. Federated Databases (Logical Partitioning)
Different partitions reside on different databases hosted on separate servers.
The application logic decides which partition (server) to query.
Example in MySQL Federated Tables

CREATE SERVER remote_server
FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER mysql
OPTIONS (USER 'remote_user', HOST '192.168.1.10', DATABASE 'remote_db');


Benefit: Queries are executed on remote partitions transparently.

Key Takeaways
✅ Partitioning can span multiple servers in distributed databases.
✅ Sharding is a special type of partitioning where each partition is stored on a separate physical database instance.
✅ Modern databases (Spanner, YugabyteDB, CockroachDB) automate partitioning across multiple servers.
✅ Federated databases use logical partitioning to distribute data across multiple independent servers.


Challenges in Sharding & Their Solutions
Sharding helps distribute data across multiple servers for scalability, but it introduces several challenges. 
Below are common problems encountered in sharding and their solutions:
    

1. Data Distribution Imbalance (Hotspots)
Problem:
Some shards get overloaded while others remain underutilized.
Example: If sharding is done by User ID (e.g., modulo-based), users with frequently accessed data might all end up on the same shard.


Solution:
Consistent Hashing: Distributes data more evenly across shards.
Range-based Sharding: Use dynamic range partitioning to split hot shards.
Auto-Rebalancing: Some databases (e.g., MongoDB, Spanner) support automatic data redistribution.

2. Cross-Shard Queries (JOINs & Aggregations)
Problem:
Queries requiring data from multiple shards (e.g., JOIN, GROUP BY, COUNT) become inefficient.
Example: Fetching a customer’s order history across different shards.
Solution:
Denormalization: Store redundant data in each shard to avoid cross-shard joins.
Global Indexing: Maintain a metadata layer that maps entities to their shards.
Distributed Query Engines: Use query engines like Presto, Apache Drill to aggregate results from multiple shards.

3. Shard Rebalancing & Resharding
Problem:
When adding new shards, data must be migrated without downtime.
Example: Adding a new database server disrupts existing shard allocations.
Solution:
Hash-based Sharding with Virtual Nodes: Helps redistribute data without reassigning all keys.
Automated Resharding: Modern distributed databases (e.g., CockroachDB, Google Spanner) rebalance automatically.
Application-Level Shard Routing: Use a shard mapping service so that changes are transparent to the application.

4. Single Point of Failure in Shard Management
Problem:
A single metadata server managing shard locations (e.g., config server in MongoDB) becomes a bottleneck or point of failure.
Solution:
Replicated Metadata Services: Distribute metadata across multiple servers (e.g., ZooKeeper, etcd).
Partitioned Metadata Storage: Spread metadata storage across multiple nodes instead of a single server.

5. Transaction Management (ACID vs. BASE)
Problem:
Ensuring consistency across multiple shards is difficult.
Example: Transferring money between users stored in different shards requires multi-shard transactions.
Solution:
Two-Phase Commit (2PC): Used in databases like Google Spanner for distributed transactions.
Eventual Consistency (BASE Model): For high-performance apps, eventual consistency is preferred over strict ACID compliance.
Distributed Transaction Coordinators: Tools like Sagas Pattern, TCC (Try-Confirm/Cancel) can manage transactions across multiple shards.


6. High Latency in Routing Queries
Problem:
Application needs to route queries to the correct shard, adding latency.
Example: If a lookup table is required to find the correct shard, it slows down performance.
Solution:
Shard-aware Clients: The application knows how data is distributed and queries the correct shard directly.
Caching & Load Balancing: Store frequently accessed shard mappings in Redis or CDN to speed up lookups.

7. Backup & Restore Complexity
Problem:
Backing up a sharded database requires taking coordinated backups across all shards.
Solution:
Sharded Backup Strategies: Use tools like Percona XtraBackup (MySQL), MongoDB Sharded Cluster Backups.
Point-in-Time Recovery: Ensure each shard’s backup is time-synchronized.
Automated Backups: Cloud databases like AWS RDS, Google Spanner provide managed backup solutions.


8. Data Duplication & Inconsistency
Problem:
Denormalization for performance can lead to data duplication, increasing storage cost and consistency issues.
Solution:
Versioning: Maintain a version field in denormalized records for consistency.
Change Data Capture (CDC): Use CDC systems like Debezium, Kafka, AWS DMS to sync updates across shards.



Summary Table of Problems & Solutions
Problem	Solution
Data Imbalance (Hotspots)	Consistent hashing, auto-rebalancing
Cross-Shard Queries	Denormalization, global indexing, distributed query engines
Resharding Overhead	Virtual nodes, auto-resharding, application-level routing
Single Point of Failure	Replicated metadata, partitioned metadata storage
Transaction Management	2PC, Sagas, BASE model, distributed coordinators
Query Routing Latency	Shard-aware clients, caching, load balancing
Backup & Restore	Sharded backups, PIT recovery, automated backups
Data Duplication	Versioning, CDC with Kafka/Debezium

Final Thoughts
Sharding is essential for scaling large applications, but it comes with trade-offs.
 Using modern distributed databases (Spanner, CockroachDB, YugabyteDB) can simplify many of these challenges.
