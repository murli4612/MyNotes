Polling vs Streaming in Distributed Systems
Polling and streaming are two common techniques for retrieving data in real-time systems, such as messaging queues, event-driven architectures, and APIs.

1. Polling
Polling is a pull-based mechanism where the client repeatedly sends requests to the server to check for new data.


How Polling Works
The client sends an HTTP request (e.g., GET /updates).
The server responds immediately with available data or an empty response.
The client waits for some time (polling interval) and sends another request.
This cycle continues.
Types of Polling


Type	           Description
Short Polling	Client sends requests at regular intervals. Server responds instantly.
Long Polling	Client sends a request, and the server holds the connection until new data is available or a timeout occurs.
Advantages of Polling

✔ Simple to implement (just periodic HTTP requests).
✔ Works with traditional REST APIs.
✔ Suitable for low-frequency updates.


Disadvantages of Polling
❌ High Latency: Delays in fetching real-time data.
❌ Wastes Resources: Constant requests even when no new data exists.
❌ Scalability Issues: High traffic on the server due to frequent requests.

2. Streaming
Streaming is a push-based mechanism where the server actively pushes data to the client when new data is available.

How Streaming Works
The client establishes a persistent connection (e.g., WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, Kafka).
The server sends updates in real-time as soon as new data is available.
The connection remains open for continuous data transfer.


Types of Streaming
Type	Description
WebSockets	Full-duplex, bidirectional communication over a single TCP connection.
Server-Sent Events (SSE)	One-way connection where the server pushes updates to the client.
Kafka Streaming	Event-driven message streaming using Apache Kafka.
gRPC Streaming	Uses HTTP/2 for high-performance data streaming.
Advantages of Streaming


✔ Real-time updates (no delay like polling).
✔ Efficient resource usage (sends data only when available).
✔ Scalable (reduces unnecessary network traffic).

Disadvantages of Streaming
❌ More complex implementation (requires persistent connections).
❌ May not be supported by all clients (e.g., browsers without WebSocket support).
❌ Requires stateful handling (managing open connections, reconnections).


Polling vs Streaming: Key Differences
Feature	Polling	Streaming
Mechanism	Client repeatedly requests data	Server pushes data in real-time
Latency	High (depends on polling interval)	Low (instant updates)
Network Usage	High (unnecessary requests)	Low (data sent only when needed)
Complexity	Easy to implement	More complex
Best for	Infrequent updates, simple APIs	Real-time data, chat, live feeds


When to Use Polling vs Streaming?


When to Use Polling vs Streaming?
Use Case	Polling	Streaming
Stock price updates	❌ No (high latency)	✅ Yes (real-time)
Live chat	❌ No (delayed messages)	✅ Yes (instant updates)
Periodic status check (e.g., order tracking)	✅ Yes (works well)	❌ No (unnecessary overhead)
Event-driven microservices	❌ No (inefficient)	✅ Yes (Kafka, WebSockets)
IoT sensor data	❌ No (wastes network)	✅ Yes (MQTT, streaming APIs)



Final Thoughts
Use polling when updates are not frequent (e.g., checking order status).
Use streaming when you need real-time updates (e.g., live chat, stock prices).
Hybrid approaches exist (e.g., polling as a fallback when streaming isn’t available)
