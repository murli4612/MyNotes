ðŸ”¹ Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
âœ… What it is: A virtual server in the cloud.
âœ… Use Case: Hosting applications, websites, or running workloads.
âœ… Key Features:

Scalable compute capacity (increase/decrease instances).
Different instance types optimized for computing, memory, or storage.
Auto Scaling for automatic resource adjustment.
âœ… Example Question:
ðŸ’¬ How do you make an EC2 instance highly available?
ðŸ’¡ Answer: Use Auto Scaling Groups and Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).


ðŸ”¹ AWS Lambda
âœ… What it is: A serverless compute service. Runs code without managing servers.
âœ… Use Case: Running backend logic, processing API requests, event-driven tasks.
âœ… Key Features:

Pay only for execution time.
Supports multiple languages (Python, Node.js, Java, etc.).
Integrates with S3, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and more.
âœ… Example Question:
ðŸ’¬ How does AWS Lambda scale?
ðŸ’¡ Answer: AWS automatically scales Lambda by running multiple instances in parallel as needed.

ðŸ”¹ Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
âœ… What it is: Object storage for any type of data (files, images, backups, etc.).
âœ… Use Case: Storing website assets, logs, and backups.
âœ… Key Features:

Highly durable (99.999999999% durability).
Versioning and lifecycle policies for data retention.
Security via IAM roles and bucket policies.
âœ… Example Question:
ðŸ’¬ How can you make an S3 bucket publicly accessible?
ðŸ’¡ Answer: Update the Bucket Policy to allow public read access, but it's recommended to use CloudFront for secure content delivery.


ðŸ”¹ Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)
âœ… What it is: Managed database service for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.
âœ… Use Case: Running relational databases without manual maintenance.
âœ… Key Features:

Automatic backups and replication.
Scaling and performance optimization.
Security via IAM and encryption.
âœ… Example Question:
ðŸ’¬ How do you improve performance in RDS?
ðŸ’¡ Answer: Use Read Replicas for scaling read operations, Aurora Serverless for auto-scaling, and indexes for optimized queries.


ðŸ”¹ Amazon API Gateway
âœ… What it is: A fully managed API service for creating, deploying, and managing APIs.
âœ… Use Case: Exposing RESTful and WebSocket APIs to clients.
âœ… Key Features:

Integrates with Lambda, EC2, and other AWS services.
Supports authentication via IAM and Cognito.
API rate limiting and caching for performance.
âœ… Example Question:
ðŸ’¬ How do you secure an API in API Gateway?
ðŸ’¡ Answer: Use IAM Roles, API Keys, Cognito, or JWT (OAuth2) for authentication and authorization.



ðŸ”¹ AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)
âœ… What it is: Controls access to AWS resources securely.
âœ… Use Case: Managing users, roles, and permissions in AWS.
âœ… Key Features:

Policies to define access levels (e.g., read-only, admin).
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for extra security.
Role-based access for services (e.g., allowing EC2 to access S3).
âœ… Example Question:
ðŸ’¬ What is the principle of least privilege in IAM?
ðŸ’¡ Answer: Give only the permissions necessary for a user or service to perform its tasks.
