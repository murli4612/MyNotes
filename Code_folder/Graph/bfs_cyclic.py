# ‚è± Time Complexity: O(V + E)
# Where:

# V = number of vertices (nodes)

# E = number of edges (connections)

# Why?
# Each node is visited exactly once (O(V)).

# Each edge is checked once (when visiting its node) ‚Üí O(E).

# Hence: O(V + E).

# üß† Space Complexity: O(V)
# Includes:
# Visited set: stores each node once ‚Üí O(V)

# Queue: can hold up to O(V) nodes in the worst case

# Call stack: in recursion, the depth will also be O(V) in the worst case

# So total space is:
# üîπ Visited: O(V)
# üîπ Queue: O(V)
# üîπ Call Stack: O(V)
# ‚û§ Overall: O(V)
