# ‚è± Time Complexity: O(V + E)
# Where:

# V = number of vertices (nodes)

# E = number of edges

# Why?
# Each node is visited once ‚Üí O(V)

# For each node, we loop over its neighbors ‚Üí all edges are explored once ‚Üí O(E)

# So overall: O(V + E)

# üß† Space Complexity: O(V)
# Common to both versions:
# Visited set: stores up to V nodes ‚Üí O(V)

# üîÅ Iterative DFS:
# Stack: can grow up to O(V) (e.g., deep linear graph like a chain)

# ‚û§ Total Space: O(V)

# üåÄ Recursive DFS:
# Call stack depth in worst case = O(V) (e.g., skewed or deep graph)

# ‚û§ Total Space: O(V)

# | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
# | Recursive DFS | `O(V + E)`      | `O(V)`           | Call stack grows with depth |
